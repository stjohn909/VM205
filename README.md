# VM205 C library (RPi, ArchLinux)

The goal of this library is to provide a basic communications API for the [Velleman VM205](www.velleman.eu/products/view/?id=418968) (Raspberry Pi oscilloscope shield), to allow users to create their own software to operate the oscilloscope and visualize or log its sample data.

Currently, the only supported platform is the **Raspberry Pi**, with a recent distribution of **ArchLinux**.

Documentation will become available after the first production release.

Uses the bcm2835 library by Mike McCauley, which somes preinstalled in ArchLinux.
