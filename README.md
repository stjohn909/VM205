# VM205 library for the Raspberry Pi (ArchLinux)

The goal of this library is to provide a basic communications API for the [Velleman VM205 Raspberry Pi oscilloscope shield](www.velleman.eu/products/view/?id=418968), to allow users to create their own software to visualize or log the data.

Currently, the only supported platform is the **Raspberry Pi**, with the current distribution of **ArchLinux**.

Documentation will become available after the first production release.
